    "description": "AWS Secrets Manager API Reference AWS Secrets Manager is a web service that\nenables you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets.\n\nThis guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more\ninformation about using this service, see the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/introduction.html].\n\n API Version \n\nThis version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager\nAPI version 2017-10-17.\n\nAs an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs,\nwhich consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and\nplatforms (such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android). The SDKs provide a\nconvenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For\nexample, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing\nerrors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS\nSDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web\nServices [http://aws.amazon.com/tools/].\n\nWe recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets\nManager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make\ndirect calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets\nManager HTTP Query API, see Making Query Requests\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/query-requests.html] \nin the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. \n\nSecrets Manager supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API\ndoesn't require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However,\nGET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for\noperations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.\n\n Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager \n\nWe welcome your feedback. Send your comments to \nawssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com [awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com],\nor post your feedback and questions in the AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum\n[http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=296]. For more information\nabout the AWS Discussion Forums, see Forums Help\n[http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa].\n\n How examples are presented \n\nThe JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and that\nthe service returns as a response to HTTP query requests are single, long\nstrings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the\nexamples is formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve\nreadability. When example input parameters would also result in long strings\nthat extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You\nshould always submit the input as a single JSON text string.\n\n Logging API Requests \n\nAWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API\ncalls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By\nusing information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which\nrequests were successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when\nit was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets Manager and its support for\nAWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail] \nin the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including\nhow to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html]\n.",
